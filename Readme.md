# Onedrop RedirectManager

Gives you the ability to manage redirects in the Neos backend.
Currently Neos 3.x only.

![Neos backend view](/Preview.png?raw=true)

**TODOs**:

* Pagination
* Sorting
* Filtering
* Regex ?!
* Validation (duplicate URIs => Redirect vs. active Node)
* Export / Import
* Autocomplete for current node URIs (targets)
* Multi-Delete
* Multi-Edit
* Audit-Logging (at least for manually created redirects)
* Neos 2.3 compatibility
